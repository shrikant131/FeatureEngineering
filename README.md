## Feature Engineering Tasks on DK Housing Prices Dataset

This repository contains a Python notebook that performs feature engineering tasks on the DK housing prices dataset. The dataset contains residential household sales during the period 1992 - 2024. The feature engineering tasks include:

- Identification of attribute types
- Handling missing data
- Normalization of numeric attributes
- Analysis of the 5 most expensive cities and cities with maximum unique zip codes
- Calculation of proximity measures between specified columns
- Feature selection using filter methods (f_regression, mutual_info_regression, correlation)
- Correlation plot
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots)
- Handling outliers using the z-score approach

## Python Notebook

The Python notebook `feature_engineering.ipynb` contains detailed steps, explanations, and visualizations for the feature engineering tasks. You can find the notebook [here](feature_engineering.ipynb).

## Documentation

The markdown file `feature_engineering_steps.md` documents the steps done at each task in the notebook. It includes details, explanations, and reasons for each step, as well as visualizations and other plots for analysis and data preprocessing. You can find the documentation [here](feature_engineering_steps.md).

## Updated Feature Engineering Tasks on New Dataset

This repository now includes an updated Python notebook `feature_engineering_e2e.ipynb` that performs feature engineering tasks on a new dataset from a government or public data portal. The updated feature engineering tasks include:

- Identification of attribute types
- Handling missing data
- Normalization of numeric attributes
- Analysis of the 5 most expensive cities and cities with maximum unique zip codes
- Calculation of proximity measures between specified columns
- Feature selection using filter methods (f_regression, mutual_info_regression, correlation)
- Correlation plot
- Visualizations (histograms, boxplots, scatter plots)
- Handling outliers using the z-score approach
- Additional regression models and evaluation, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

## Updated Python Notebook

The updated Python notebook `feature_engineering_e2e.ipynb` contains detailed steps, explanations, and visualizations for the updated feature engineering tasks. You can find the notebook [here](feature_engineering_e2e.ipynb).

## Updated Documentation

The markdown file `feature_engineering_steps.md` has been updated to reflect the new dataset and preprocessing steps. It includes details, explanations, and reasons for each step, as well as visualizations and other plots for analysis and data preprocessing. You can find the updated documentation [here](feature_engineering_steps.md).
